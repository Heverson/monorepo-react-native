<p align="center">
This project is a <strong>(PoC) Proof of Concept</strong>, Monorepo for Apps Reat Native. 
</p>

<h2>WHY</h2>
<p>
Maybe you need to reuse react native components or useful functions, sharing these components in apps. Monorepo can be an alternative.
</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>This example, i create two apps <strong><a href="https://docs.expo.dev/bare/exploring-bare-workflow/">Expo Bare Workflow</a></strong> with typescript</p>

<p>I create folder shared, with subfolders for components and functions shared between apps.</p>
<p>This components folder, add two components (InputText) and (Button).<strong> <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/">Yarn Workspace</a></strong> this possible integrate this components in MyAppOne and MyAppTwo</p>
